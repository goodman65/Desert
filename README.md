modified theme from the original work of paullinuxthemer

test specs: 
* Pop!_OS 20.04
* Gnome 3.36
* Font Scaling Factor 1.25
* Screen Resolution 1920*1080

fonts set to `Fira Sans` and `PingFang SC` in order to support Simplified Chinese characters. this may affect the interface font of some software including `Firefox` installed via `apt`. the `PingFang` fonts can be found in macOS. if you have trouble finding those, I also recommend `Noto Sans SC`.

some minor changes in `gnome-shell.css` to make more sense in my opinion.
